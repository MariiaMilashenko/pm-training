# Questions:

> What are the most popular IDEs for development?

<p>The Internet says that the most popular IDEs nowadays are:
Visual Studio, Eclipse, Android Studio, Vim, NetBeans and others.</p>
<p>As for me, I've been using only VS for C++ development and IntelliJ IDEA for Java during my students years, thereby they are the most favourite and familiar to me.</p>

> What is .gitignore file for?

<p>When creating projects it's often necessary that Git ignore settings of various IDEs. For example, there are some developers using IDEA. The IDEA works so that some stuff like open files and other things are saved in the .idea folder. So, if some developer download this folder to repository, other developers will have the same stuff from this folder. This situation is likely to be highly undesirable because different developers may need different files, etc.</p>
<p>In order not to let it happen the .idea folder can be blocked in the .gitignore file. Thus, there would be no conflicts.</p>

> What's the difference between compiled and interpreted language?

<p>Interpreted language is executed at the run time according to the instructions. </p>
<p>Compiled language is one which converted into an executable form (changed into assembly language, which CPU can understand) before being executed. For instance C++.</p>
<p>Some interpreted languages are first compiled to some form of virtual machine code, which is then either interpreted or compiled at run-time to native code. Like Java.For instance, javac compiles human-readbale .java files into machine-readable .class files.</p>

> What are the different types of web hosting exist?

<p>Web hostings differentiate by storage capacity, control, technical knowledge requirement, server speed and reliability. There are:<br>
* Shared hosting - many websites are stored on the same server and share it's resources(RAM,CPU). The cost of such hosting is relatively low.<br>
* Visual private server - websites are hosted within their own spaces on the server but still share physical server.VPS provide more customization and storage space.<br>
* Dedicated hosting -  server is exclusively rented by a website, its the only one stored on it.<br>
* Cloud hosting - a hosting solution that works via a network and enables users to employ as many resources as they need.The resources that are being used are spread across several servers, reducing the chance of any downtime.<br>
* Managed hosting - the provider of hosting company looks after the day-to-day management of the hardware, operating systems and standardised applications.<br>
* Colocation - renting space in a colocation center that provides power, bandwidth and other stuff server requires. Everything(like hardware, software, services) should be taken care of.</p>
